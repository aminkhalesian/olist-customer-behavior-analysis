# Olist Customer Behavior Analysis

This is my first real business/data case study using the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce public dataset.

**Goal**  
Understand how new customers behave:  
- How many buy only once?  
- How much do they spend on their first order?  
- Are there big differences by state?  
- Overall, does the platform keep customers coming back?

**Tech used**  
- SQL (SQLite + DB Browser for SQLite)  
- Tableau Public for visualization  
- Some help from AI for cleaner queries and structure

**Key findings**  
- 94.24% of customers buy only once  
- ~47.6% spend less than 100 BRL on first order  
- Big regional differences (North/Northeast much higher AOV than SP)
